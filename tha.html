							<blockquote>Psychological safety describes a climate where people have the ability to speak their minds and challenge potentially controversial ideas or questions without fear.</blockquote>
							<p>The tech industry is a stressful pace. Deadlines, long hours, complicated domain knowledge, a fast-moving state-of-the-art, and a cut-throat level of competition between companies can manifest as a looming feeling of dread that contributes to mistakes, misunderstanding, and burnout. Big projects often have many stakeholders - both internal and external - and a huge amount of funding or share price value may be on the line when it comes to executing a big software release.</p>
							<p>In 2020 this got even worse with COVID putting at risk the health, safety, and financial well being of our friends and family.</p>
							
							<div class="featureLink">For more info on this topic, read the article <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it">High Performing Teams Need Psychological Safety</a> by the Harvard Business Review</div>
							
							<p>While watching millions of people being laid off across hundreds of industries, seeing our own performance review cycles and bonus opportunities cancelled, and having our work life literally invading our homes, we're still expected to carry on delivering product value and making sure not to let our roadmaps drift off course or introduce critical bugs. New hires are expected to fit in with teams they've never met face to face, those who are differently abled were expected to 'make it work' over Zoom and other online tools, and the rest of us were told we had to step up and ensure our companies wouldn't end up in the red.</p>

							<blockquote>Healthy organizations foster constructive conflict. Good leaders break down barriers to candid communication so that their organizations can address competitive threats effectively.</blockquote>

						<div class="content">
							<blockquote>Team Health Assessments are a periodic meeting (usually held quarterly) during which an entire product team performs a retrospective on a number of consistent “metrics” relating to team performance, support, and their mental well being.</blockquote> 
							
							<p>These metrics cover a broad range of individual aspects of our daily work life, encompassing project, product, or team dynamics. Just like a weekly retrospective, the space allows for everyone to discuss how they are feeling. But unlike a weekly retrospective, these meetings look back on several months of work, and the structure and dialog is focused on addressing and improving working process, interpersonal relationships, and support hierarchy.</p>

							<p>A modern product and engineering team is a complex system, and its success depends on getting a lot of different things right. Similar to the complex software systems we build, teams can be improved over time through constant small iterations if we build the right feedback mechanisms. The Team Health Assessment allows a team to recognize, communicate and receive the support required to continuously improve.</p>
								
							<p>The goal of the exercise is the quality of the discussion, not populating the scorecard. We encourage facilitation to ensure time isn’t lost on the same topic over and over again, but we caution against strictly time boxing discussions.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>In the days before COVID19, Pivotal's R&D offices were spread across North America and the UK. We frequently held Team Health Assessments in the office, choosing snacks and drinks and then taking over a conference room for a few hours.</p>
