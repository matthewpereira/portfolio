							<blockquote>Context means everything in product design.</blockquote>
							<p>Knowing and understanding your users is key to success for any product designer, and having fresh, reliable data is a powerful way to uncover new opportunities and prioritize the pain points you already know about.</p>

							<p>When I joined Pivotal Software in 2019, and started working with Concourse CI, the team had been collecting information from Pivotal's enterprise customers, internal teams dogfooding the product, and open source users and teams from companies around the world. This data had been collected through a variety of channels over the past years, and now resided in forms data, a mix of customer profiles and meeting notes, a team wiki, and the Slack and Discord channels that the team maintained for the project.</p>

							<p>As a way to get to know the product and its users, my new team suggested that I check out the data and try to come up with a good way to sort everything into a more useable and sustainable collection.</p>

							<a id="data" class="anchorLink"></a><h2>What kind of data?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Within all the spreadsheets, documents, wiki articles, and transcripts mentioned above, there were several key types of data to keep track of:</p>

							<ul class="noBullet">
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-face.png"></span><li class="emojilist"><strong>People</strong> - Actual Concourse users or related contacts</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-money.png"></span><li class="emojilist"><strong>Companies</strong> - The enterprises buying our products and employing our users</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-survey.png"></span><li class="emojilist"><strong>Survey data</strong> - Raw data from customer and community outreach, usually conducted on an annual basis</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-notes.png"></span><li class="emojilist"><strong>Meeting notes</strong> - Touchpoints that teach us about common pain points, feature requests, user workflows, and unique deployment needs</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-chart.png"></span><li class="emojilist"><strong>Internal audit information</strong> - What teams and products were using Concourse to create revenue elsewhere in the company?</li>
							</ul>
								
							<p>Our team needed a way to tie all of this information together, and keep track of it in a way that would scale with the product.</p>

					<!-- Section -->
					<section id="first">
						<header>
							<a id="who" class="anchorLink"></a><h2>Who would be using it?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Before diving into possible solutions, however, there was another dimension to consider: I also had to consider the rest of my team.

							<p>I met with the PM and a number of engineer on the team over the first two weeks that I started working at Pivotal. Concourse was staffed as two divisions and several sub-tracks of work on an engineering team of 16 at the time, divided between enterprise customer features, platform automation, runtime, web UI, release engineering, and other concerns.</p>
								
							<h3>User Segments</h3>
								
							<p>What I learned was that we would have to put special effort into surfacing the right information to the right people at the right time. While this might sound fundamental, different people on the team needed quantitative and qualitative data for very different reasons depending on their focus as well as what given initiative they might be working on at a point in time.</p>
								
							<p>Some Concourse engineers were preoccupied with enterprise concerns: scalability, stability, orchestrating and planning massive upgrades, and troubleshooting mission-critical Concourse installations.</p>
								
							<p>Others were focused on the open source experience for developers at startups, or hobbyists working on their own code, running Concourse on their own laptops.</p>
								
							<p>Being able to sort and segment our data to pinpoint different needs across this spectrum - and several others - was crucial to our success. It was also something that resonated with me very closely as a designer new to the project, as I very much wanted to start breaking down our users into personas at the same time.</p>
								
							<h3>Stakeholder Interests</h3>
								
							<p>One of the other learnings at this point in my process was the amount of outside interest in our product. Our field teams were heavily invested in learning about sentiment and success with each new release of our product, since their careers depended on knowing how to deploy Concourse in customer engagements. It was also crucial for them to know what user concerns were so that they could anticipate and accommodate them in the enterprises that were buying our platform.</p>
								
							<p>Additionally, there were a number of related programs and leaders who wanted a way to track and measure our team's return on investment. The number of engineers working on Concourse at the time was ambitious, and reporting on user trends, adoption, and sentiment across different demographics was an important factor in maintaining business investment in our work. I met the director of product and director of engineering, as well as a sales engineer, to make sure I understood their perspectives.</p>
								
							<p>Whatever path my work took, it needed to be easily shareable and digestible by both of these groups and others, while also being secure and private at the same time.</p>

							<p>From here, I could make a clear list of outcomes to solve for:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Catalog top features and pain points to cast a broad net for problems to solve</li>
								<li>Correlate data to insights to validate and prioritize solutions we generate</li>
								<li>Build a comprehensive list of potential research paticipants for interviews and usability testing</li>
								<li>Track meetings with customer teams and key contacts to avoid burning out our relationships</li>

#### Solutions: Why not...?

With all the details laid out before me, I knew that we needed a tool that could handle a lot of quantitative data. There was a tradeoff to be made on the qualitative side of things. I built a competitive analysis of the different options available to us in order to make sure that the chosen tool or platform would create the outcomes we needed.

* Google Sheets / Excel - requires too much data validation, can’t link multiple records without special data structures
* An RDBMS - inflexible, user admin overhead
* Salesforce - too inflexible, many stakeholders
* Aha - too rigid
* Specialist tools (ProductBoard, Notion, Dovetail etc) - either too costly or legal implications (at least in the past)

#### Solutions: Why Airtable?

In the end, one tool - Airtable - was the best compromise. It had:

* Record linking
* Saved 'views'
* Concurrent edits
* Easy to share
* Sortable, filterable, groupable
* Built in survey capabilities
* Role-based access control
* Share links that could be set to expire
* Automation and notifications

#### Designing the schema

Going back to the different types of data I had to accommodate, I built out a plan for relating all of my gathered information together.

						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The Concourse team interacts with its open source community and customer-base on a daily basis, collecting and cataloging feedback. This research initiative originated because our 2019 customer and community surveying efforts revealed that performance was one of the top pain points for our users. No matter how good a product is, users will want it to perform better. However, 'performance' can mean more than just one thing to different groups of users.</p>

							<p>If I were working in a green-field project, this part of the process would involve creating and validating personas, and other typical design rituals. Concourse is a mature product, however, so in this scenario we had a wealth of demographic, configuration, needs and wants, pain points, and other data points collected through our survey data that we could use to segment and qualify our problem.</p>

								</a>
							</div>

							<p>Delving through the responses from these surveys provided us with a variety of different suggestions and opportunities. In order to find out exactly which performance issues were the most pertinent and valuable for us to solve, we had to begin with user research to uncover more specific insights.</p>

							<a id="problem" class="anchorLink"></a><h2>Problem Definition and Framing</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Starting with teams in our company who use Concourse as part of their path to production, then reaching out to key customers, and then to open source users running mission-critical Concourse installations, we sought to validate four key performance issues that had been reported:</p>

							<ol>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-hourglass.png" /></span>
								<li class="emojilist"><strong>Time to first paint</strong> - Issues where the Concourse Web UI was slow to respond to a browser's request, leading to a delay before users see <em>anything</em> load on screen</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-lock.png" /</span>
								<li class="emojilist"><strong>Time to interactivity</strong> - Issues where the Concourse web instance loaded, only to appear 'locked' while job and task information is loaded from the API</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-turtle.png" /</span>
								<li class="emojilist"><strong>Scrolling and interaction performance</strong> - Issues where the user's browser can't render the page quickly enough to provide smooth scrolling frame rates, or clicks the user makes when navigating or starting tasks aren't responsive without noticeable delays.</li>
								<span class="listemoji"><img src="images/emoji-snowflake.png" /</span>
								<li class="emojilist"><strong>Long term performance over time between refreshes</strong> - Issues where the Web UI performance would degrade and eventually freeze up after being left open as a dashboard for hours or days at a time.</li>
							</ol>
								
							<p>I devised a research plan and interview script that focused on observing the actual behavior of our users - their Concourse instances, their computers, their choice of browser, their internet connections, and also their specific workflows and needs - while we guided them through their everyday tasks. This contextual inquiry was conducted with my PM and a member of our engineering team in each interview, so that they could take notes and understand the insights revealed first-hand, developing their own perspectives on what we were learning while I worked with each participant.</p>

							<div class="gallery">

								</a>
							</div>
							
							<img src="images/fastboard_prioritization.jpg" class="floatRight" />
							
							<p><strong>Through this contextual inquiry and direct observation, we learned that time to interactivity was the most prevelant and the highest priority.</strong> We learned that scrolling and interactivity performance was limited to users running unsupported browsers, but <em>could</em> be a problem across all browsers in the future, if left unchecked. The issue of 'time to first paint' was negligible in any of the production and test environments we observed, no matter what the scale, so it was prioritized behind the others. And lastly, we were able to fully invalidate the fourth issue entirely by following up with the users who had originally reported it - this issue was limited to users running an outdated version of Concourse, and was solved during their next upgrade cycle.</p>

							<blockquote>At this point we had a clear understanding of a multidimensional problem space, an evidence-backed prioritization, and had learned what we needed in order to start developing solutions that we knew would provide real value to our users, without any risk of wasting time on the wrong issue.</blockquote>

							<p>Working with what we knew from our research, the team and I were able to replicate the problems our users were experiencing, and then able to determine root causes for each of the performance issues. With the input of the team to help balance business, technical, and user needs, we came up with strategies for alleviating each problem.</p>

							<h2>Solving Problem 1</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Concourse works by making a request for pipeline and task status for all of the different pipelines on the system when the app loads. This first payload of data can be calculated and delivered in milliseconds on most Concourse installations, but as with all features, scale makes things difficult. When there are hundreds or thousand of complicated pipelines, the first delivery - and every subsequent delivery - slows down.</p>

							<p>Modern applications on the web *ease* this problem by displaying a skeleton or mock UI while the real data is loading - like the empty, shaded tweets and Facebook stories that appear upon first load before the real content flickers into view seconds later. This makes it feel like the app is loading faster than it really is, and lessens the worry that something is wrong that a blank screen or loading spinner might create.</p>
								
							<p>We implemented this strategy alongside a caching strategy. Pipeline status changes all the time, but in many use cases the pipelines themselves only change occasionally. By recording a snapshot of the pipelines the first time they load, and then refreshing it from time to time, we could give the Concourse UI enough data to let the users start interacting with it - they could search, scroll, sort, and click - while the live data loads in the background.</p>

							<div class="gallery">
								<a href="images/fastboard_caching.gif" class="full">
									<img src="images/fastboard_caching.gif" alt="" />
									<span>A page refresh using our caching implementation, slowed down many times to make visible the transition from initial load, cache refresh, to live data.</span>
								</a>
							</div>
								
							<p>Now, even when data was slow to appear, a user's familiar pipelines appeared almost instantly. Users were no longer 'locked' or stalled; they could start navigating working while live data was loading. This meant our product looked and felt blazing fast, even when our users' infrastructure was busy, or their internet connection wasn't ideal. 🏎</p>

							<h2>Solving Problem 2</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>It was no secret on the team that over the years Concourse's web UI had developed a fairly heavy DOM structure - the combination of elements needed to render pipelines and the tasks they contained. This complex and data-rich display is what makes Concourse's UI so valuable, but also meant that before this initiative began the browser had to paint and repaint tens or hundreds of thousands of individual pieces of the interface every second.</p>

							<p>Constantly updating and repainting like this meant that scrolling in some browsers could appear choppy or stutter sporadically. The more pipelines a Concourse deployment was supporting, the more CPU is required to power the front end experience. This isn't a big deal for most users, because most people run fairly modest CI/CD operations... but on the many-thousands-of-pipelines scale that our bigger customers run, the web interface could become unusable. An unusable web interface means operations teams can't observe, manage, and troubleshoot.</p>
							
							<p>The team dedicated a pair of engineers for a week to spike on a refactoring strategy. We saw some improvements in these first experiments, but the issue of scale meant that huge customers could still see problems. <strong>Sooner or later, someone would build a Concourse big enough to overload their browser again. We needed a solution that removed scale from the equation.</strong></p>
							
							<p>At my previous company Statflo, I had worked with a front-end engineer to implement an infinite scrolling solution to handle many thousands of items in <a href="conversations.html">a messaging app</a>. This strategy removes elements that aren't on screen at any given time, and then dynamically fills them in as needed when the user scrolls. Using this technique, the browser only ever has to keep track of a few hundred elements, no matter how many pipelines and tasks a Concourse deployment may be supporting.</p>

							<div class="gallery">
								<a href="images/fastboard_infinitescroll.gif" class="full">
									<img src="images/fastboard_infinitescroll.gif" alt="" />
									<span>A test showing how pipeline cards are seamlessly created in the DOM on the right as they scroll into view, and then disappear again when the user scrolls up.</span>
								</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>This implementation had a much more dramatic effect than our first iteration, exponentially improving responsiveness. It essentially levels the playing field between small installations all the way up to the most demanding enterprise environments, since the browser only ever has to handle a little more than the number of elements that can fit in the user's viewport at any one time.</p>
							
							<p>Our work tidying up the DOM structure and then implementing the infinite scrolling technique significantly reduced the CPU required to render the web UI, making scrolling issues a thing of the past. With this new code, our test environments scrolled smoothly and responsively in all of the major browsers, no matter how many pipelines we configured.</p>
						</div>

					<!-- Section -->
					<section>
						<header>
							<a id="outcomes" class="anchorLink"></a><h2>Results & Outcomes</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Throughout the initiative we were using a number of different systems to track a baseline for each scenario, and to measure our results - Concourse installations provisioned using virtual infrastructure on GCP and vSphere as well as on-premise hardware in our office. We also tested a number of different configurations to mimic Concourse installations of different scales - many pipelines, few pipelines, pipelines of varying compute requirements, and with different amounts of build histories - in order to get a comprehensive look at how our proposed solutions would affect a wide spectrum of users.</p>

							<p>We were able to reduce the time it took to load all the pipelines and make the app interactive by a factor of between 4x to 5x in our test environments. The more you scale up, the greater the benefits. On its own this change would have made users' lives significantly better, but the additional ability to interact with cached data immediately meant that users hunting for a specific pipeline from our dashboard could begin interacting with the product with as little as a 2 second delay, whereas before our test environments would take as much as 10 to 14 seconds to become interactive.</p>

							<p>We tested these initial results with teams using Concourse internally, and then merged the code into our OSS v6.0.0 release. This gave us the opportunity to get initial feedback from the community while we fine tuned the results, adjusting our next v6.1.0 release to polish the way we represented cached data and then replaced it on the fly once live data was available.</p>
