## 1. Install 
    # With npm
    npm install kwesforms

    # With yarn
    yarn add kwesforms

## 2. Import

```js
// Use import
import kwesforms from 'kwesforms';

// or require
const kwesforms = require('kwesforms');
```

## 3. Initialize 
Include this method in the mounted function of the component/view that you will use KwesForms in. 

```js
kwesforms.init();
```

## 4. Set up your form

Create your form with your own HTML and CSS as you normally would. All you need to do is:

- Add our `kwes-form` class to your form tag.
- Add the action URL we provide when you create an account with us.

```html
<form class="kwes-form" action="https://kwes.io/api/foreign/forms/{your_form_id}">
    ...
</form>
```

## 5. Add validation rules (optional)

Add our validation rules to your fields inside a `rules` attribute. You can add multiple validation rules by seperating them with a `|` character. Our rules validate on the frontend and the backend simultaneously: 
- As you type
- When you click away from a field
- When you click submit.

### Example

```html
<input type="text" rules="required|min:5|alpha_dash">
```
